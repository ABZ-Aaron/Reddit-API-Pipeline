## Reddit API

For this project we'll be taking data from Reddit. Specifically, the `r/DataEngineering` sub. 

> Feel free to change the subreddit in the extract_reddit_etl.py script.

To extract Reddit data, we need to use its Application Programming Interface ([API](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api)). There's a couple steps you'll need to follow to set this up.

1. Create a [Reddit account](https://www.reddit.com/register/).
2. Navigate [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and create an app. Make sure you select "script" from the radio buttons during the setup process.
3. Take a note of a few things once this is setup:

    - the App name
    - the App ID
    - API Secret Key
