# Reddit Pipeline

This is an independent project put together after completing a DataTalksClub [BootCamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp).

It is an ETL pipeline to pull Reddit data from [r/dataengineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/) using Reddit's API and load it into an AWS Data Warehouse.
